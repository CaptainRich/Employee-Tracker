## Project Objective
As A business owner I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
so that I can organize and plan my business.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a command-line application that accepts user input

1) When I start the application then I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.

2) When I choose to view all departments then I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids.

3) When I choose to view all roles then I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.

4) When I choose to view all employees then I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to.

5) When I choose to add a department then I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database.

6) When I choose to add a role then I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database.

7) When I choose to add an employee then I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager and that employee is added to the database.

8) When I choose to update an employee role then I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database.

## Technologies Used
* The NPM package inquirer.
* The NPM package mysql2.
* The NPM package console.table.

## Employee Tracker Logic
As the application starts (from the command line with 'node index') a connection to a MySQL database is setup.  This connection is used in all subsequent access to the 'staff_db' database.

The application then presents the user with a menu of possible actions (as discussed in 'acceptance criteria #1' above).  This menu is redisplayed after each action selected by the user.  Each action invokes its own function to perform its task, sometimes requesting additional information from the user.

In setting up the environment for this application, MySQL is started from the command line and then the 'schema' and 'seeds' files are used to define data for the initial database.
